                    <p class="portfolio-titles">Design</p>
                    <p>During ideation stage, I was thinking of the style I want for my VR scene. I went with the horror theme as I occasionally play horror games 
                        with my friends, titles such as "Devour", "Inside the backrooms" and "Demonologist". I like the adrenaline and psychological elements that comes with 
                        it. I wanted to infuse suspense, tension and fear into my game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Infused forms of clues to help the player get through the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Included weapons into parts of some puzzles, allowing players to wield and use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Each puzzle is of different difficulty so that players don't feel bored throughout the game.
                    </p>

                <p>During the development stage of the scene, I realised that 1 room wasn't enough to contain all 3 puzzles 
                    so I decided to make 2 addition rooms, a bathroom and a bedroom in addition to the living room.
